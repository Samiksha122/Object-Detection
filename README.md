# Object-Detection 
# Task 1 : The Sparks Foundation Graduate Rotational Internship Program GRIPJAN21
Object Detection / Optical Character Recognition (ORC)

Problem Statement - Implement an object detector which identifies the classes of the objects in
an image or video. 

I used MobileNet SSD V3 object detector in this project. The speed-accuracy-space graph of this object detector is very good for implementation in real time.
